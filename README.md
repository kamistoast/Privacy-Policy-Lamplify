# Privacy Policy - Lamplify
Lamplify is owned and maintained by me, Nico Amann ("Klaus Amann"). 

All of the content you might add to Lamplify will always remain private. None of your data or personal information is collected in any way or manner.

If you choose to allow Lamplify microphone access, you can use the /party/ feature. This allows you to detect the noise level of your environment and turn it into colors. While accessing the microphone, Lamplify records your audio. After quitting the /party/ feature (or leaving the app) Lamplify instantly delets all the recorded audio files and the microphone is not longer accessed. Apple indicates microphone access with a orange dot in the right corner of your device.

Lamplify does not use third-party frameworks.
